# HR Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on HR Data Analysis for Afame Technologies, involving data cleansing and analysis of HR-related data. The primary tools used are Jupyter Notebook (Python) for data analysis and Power BI for visualization.

## Project Structure

- **hr_data_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code for data analysis.
- **afame_hr_analysis.pbix**: Power BI file for visualizing HR data insights.

## Project Activities

### Data Cleansing

1. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: Eliminated irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset.
2. **Column Renaming**: Gave meaningful names to columns for clarity and consistency.
3. **Eliminating Redundant Entries**: Identified and removed duplicate records.
4. **Sanitizing Specific Columns**: Cleaned and standardized specific columns for uniformity.

### Handling Missing Values

1. **Eliminating NaN Values**: Removed missing values to ensure data integrity.

### Additional Changes

- Conducted a thorough review of the dataset and implemented additional changes for improved analysis if necessary.

## Instructions

### Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `hr_data_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the data analysis code.

### Power BI
